# VehicleSpeedAnalysis
This project focuses on predicting car actions based on their speed using machine learning models. The initial version (v1.0) implements a basic model to classify car actions such as "normal speed," "moving fast," and "moving really fast." The subsequent version (v1.1) includes comparisons of multiple models to determine the most accurate one for this task.


# Key Features
Speed-Based Action Prediction: Classifies car actions based on speed thresholds.
Data Handling: Uses synthetic datasets for training and testing.
Model Comparison: Evaluates various machine learning models for best performance.
